### Projects

1. DL Basics
This folder contains basic deep learning concepts and examples that were part of your learning journey. It includes:

Neural Networks: Implementation of basic neural networks from scratch.
Activation Functions: Exploration of various activation functions such as ReLU, Sigmoid, and Tanh.
Optimization Techniques: Understanding gradient descent and its variants.
Loss Functions: Implementation of different loss functions and their applications.
Matrixs, dropout regularizations, handling imbalance data, image classification function also explores in this folder.

2. Face Emotion Detection
This project uses deep learning techniques to detect and classify the emotions displayed on human faces. The model is trained on a dataset of facial expressions and can identify emotions such as happiness, sadness, surprise, anger, and more.

### Features
Emotion Detection: Detects and classifies emotions from facial images.
Preprocessing: Includes data preprocessing steps such as face detection, alignment, and normalization.
Model Architecture: Utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNN) for feature extraction and emotion classification.
Performance Metrics: Evaluates model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
