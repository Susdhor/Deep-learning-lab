# Breast Cancer Classification using Neural Networks

This project focuses on classifying breast cancer using a neural network. We aim to build a prediction system that can determine whether a given breast cancer case is malignant or benign based on various features.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following main components:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
    - Loading and cleaning the dataset.
    - Normalizing features.
    - Splitting the data into training and testing sets.

2. **Model Building**:
    - Constructing the neural network architecture using TensorFlow and Keras.
    - Compiling the model with appropriate loss function and optimizer.

3. **Model Training**:
    - Training the neural network on the training dataset.
    - Monitoring performance using validation data.

4. **Model Evaluation**:
    - Evaluating the modelâ€™s performance on the test dataset.
    - Generating classification metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).

5. **Prediction System**:
    - Creating a system to make predictions on new data.
    - Implementing a user interface (if applicable) for easy interaction.
